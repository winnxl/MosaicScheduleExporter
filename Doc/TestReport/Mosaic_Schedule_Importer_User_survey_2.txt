Mosaic Schedule Importer User survey
Respond to as many fields as possible with comments as needed. 

Did you successfully use the software to import your Mosaic Schedule into Google Calendars? [Y/N + Comments]
Yes

Was the software easy to use? [Y/N + Comments]
Yes, the software itself was easy to use.

Were the instructions clear? Did they guide you step by step? [Y/N + Comments]
The instructions themselves are located in a tab at the top - constantly returning to them can become cumbersome. 

Were the response times to your actions acceptable? [Y/N]
Yes. With regards to the import action, perhaps having a loading icon would be helpful so that people recognize that an action is being performed (and it's not just stalling)

Did you run into any difficulty/problems/errors during use? [Comments]
Only 1; when it came time to press 'Allow' after logging into the Google Account - checking back with the how-to menu 'stalled' the program.

Given the color scheme, was the text easy to read? [Y/N]
Yes, it was easy to read. But perhaps using more colours to guide the user would be beneficial. 

Other feedback or comments?
Including department code in the course box (i.e. GEO, ENG, etc.)
