\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}
\hspace{5mm}
The purpose of the test plan is to build confidence in the correctness of the implementation for the project, MAC Schedule Importer. 
\color{blue}The test plan will provide an overview of the potential test cases for the product. As well, the plan will have a guideline on the testing approaches and methods used along with the testing tools that will be used to implement the tests. Additionally, the document shall have a brief summary of the tests to verify and validate that the functional and non-functional requirements are met.
\color{black}

\subsection{Scope}
\hspace{5mm}
The scope of the test plan is to provide a basic testing platform for the correctness and functionality of the software. The test plan includes a description of the testing procedures, tools and test cases that will be implemented to verify and validate the software for this project.
\color{blue}
Each functional and non-functional requirement that is listed in the Software Specifications Requirements document will be provided a test case to ensure the requirement is met for the final version of the application. The test case will include the type of testing (manual, automated, black box, white box, etc.) as well as the input and output results expected for the test case. Furthermore, a brief description on how the test will be performed will be given for teach test case.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
\color{blue}
\hspace{5mm}This application will be a reimplementation of the open source Chrome extension UMD Google Calendar Schedule Importer, which imports the classschedule for students at the University of Maryland into Google Calendar. The reimplementation will be modified to allow students from McMaster University to export their class schedule from Mosaic and import it into their Google Calendar through a desktop application.
\color{black}

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
\hspace{5mm}
The software will parse Mosaic for a user's schedule and then export it to a list. This list will then be used to import their schedule into their Google calendar. The implementation will be completed in Python 3.6.\\


\color{blue}
The  application  will  first  require  the  student  to  download  a  html  fileof  their  schedule  which  they  can  retrieve  through  the  application’s  link  toMosaic.   Next,  the  program  will  request  the  user  to  upload  the  file  to  theapplication where the application will display schedule information in textformat.   The  user  will  then  confirm  that  the  schedule  is  correct  and  theapplication will direct the student to log in to their Google account.  Oncethe program acquires the user’s permission to access their Google accountand  their  Google  Calendar,  the  application  will  import  the  schedule  intoGoogle Calendars.
\color{black}

\subsection{Test Team}
\hspace{5mm}
The members of Team 0C are Cassandra Nicolak, Michelle Leung and Winnie Liang are the current test team for this project. \\


\color{blue}
However, in the future development of this project, the test team will be separate from the design and implementation team to ensure no conflict of interest when testing. Thus, different teams will be used to test the product for future implementations of the application.
\color{black}
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}

\subsection{Testing Tools}
\hspace{5mm}The current testing tools that will be used are PyTest and Pycharm. PyTest will be used to automate unit testing. \color{blue} Coverage.py will be used for coverage checking and PyCharm will be used for debugging.

\color{blue}
In the future revision of the product, other testing tools will be considered. Some testing tools that may be considered are doctest, testify, testlib and PyMock. The usage of the multiple testing tools will build confidence in the correctness of the MAC Schedule Importer application.

\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
Both implementations perform the task of parsing an html document that contains a user's schedule information and then imports that information into a Google calendar. Both implementations are intended for different Universities. The existing implementation is written in JavaScript, whereas the re-implementation is written in Python 3. Another difference is that since the existing implementation is written in JavaScript, it is run as a Chrome extension through a web browser. The re-implementation will be executed as a Desktop application.


\section{Unit Testing Plan}
\color{blue}Test cases will run on Windows.	\color{black}
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Every internal function will be tested with the following cases, where applicable: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item A case where the function takes input it is expected to handle. 
\item All edge cases.
\item Cases for all run-time errors and exceptions. (Whitebox)
\item If the function receives input from a user, a case where it does not receive the expected input.
\end{enumerate}
	
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}		
Due to the user privacy constraint, no output files will be saved locally on a user's machine.
However, the output of the software will be live on a user's Google calendar. The correctness of the output will be tested by getting calendar data of a sample event from a Google calendar and \color{blue} manually \color{black} compared it to what it should be.
