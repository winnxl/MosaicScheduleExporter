This document describes the requirements for MAC Schedule Importer.  The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template  \cite{volere}.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\hspace{5mm}The purpose of this project is to reimplement the open-source Chrome extension UMD Google Calendar Schedule Importer, which imports the class schedule for students at the University of Maryland into Google Calendar. The reimplementation will be modified to allow students from McMaster University to import their schedules from Mosaic through a Desktop application.

\subsection{The Client, the Customer, and Other Stakeholders}
\hspace{5mm}The stakeholders of this project are currently the development team (0C) as well as the students and educational staff of the McMaster University course SFWRENG 3XA3. Other stakeholders of the application include McMaster University students and McMaster's University Technology Services.  Additionally, potential stakeholders include third parties such as Google, open-software developers and other universities that may be interested in our product for their usage.

\subsection{Users of the Product}
\hspace{5mm}The main users of this application will be McMaster students who would like to have their academic schedules easily accessible through their Google Calendars. The user group may vary from having very basic to advance knowledge of computers, software applications and mobile devices. All users are expected to be able to use and have access to a computer. Moreover, the user is assumed to be connected to the Internet to have access to Mosaic and Google Calendars from their preferred browser. 

\section{Project Constraints}

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
\hspace{5mm}The primary constraint for this application is that it must have similar functionality and design to the original source code. The application must be a reimplementation of the UMD Schedule Importer. Additionally, the user's operating system must also be taken into consideration. 
Another constraint is that Mosaic shuts down for weekly maintenance every Thursday from 18:00 - 22:00. Also, Mosaic may have outages from certain periods of time which will impact development and testing. Lastly, all deliverables for this application must be completed prior to December 5th, 2018.
\subsection{Naming Conventions and Definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mosaic: McMaster University's online administrative information system.
\item MacID: A McMaster University student's login account.
\item UMD Schedule Importer:  University of Maryland's Google Calendar Schedule Importer that was developed by a previous student.
\item Functional Requirements: Requirements that describe the behaviour of the application.
\item UI: User Interface.
\item Non-functional Requirements: Requirements that describe the qualities of the application.
\item User: A person who will be using the final version of the application. 
\item Calendar: Refers to a user's Google Calendar.
\item Schedule: A user's academic timetable accessed through Mosaic.
\item SFWRENG 3XA3: Software Engineering 3XA3 - Software Engineering Practice and Experience: Software Project Management. A course at McMaster University.

\end{itemize}
\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\hspace{5mm}The application will be intended to be used by McMaster University students who are currently enrolled in courses. Users must also have a valid MacID and password in order to log into Mosaic. Users must have a valid Google Mail account as well. It will be assumed that users have, at a minimum, general knowledge to operate computers in order to run the desktop application.

\end{itemize}
\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Porting Capabilities
\begin{itemize}
\item
The original source code that the application is based on is written in a web-based programming language and is designed for Google Chrome applications. The reimplemented application will be written in a different programming language and not as a Google Chrome extension.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\hspace{5mm}
Mosaic has an available schedule exporter. However, it is limited since it cannot be used with certain browsers and requires a waiting period of one day before schedule changes can be included in the export. Hence, we would like to create a more reliable and efficient application. 

\subsection{New Problems}
\hspace{5mm}
Not applicable. The application will not affect the existing UMD Importer or Mosaic in any way.
\subsection{Tasks}
\hspace{5mm}
The project's tasks are dictated by the deliverable outline provided by the SFWRENG 3XA3 course. The final implementation and all documentation must be completed by December 5th, 2018. See Deliverables under section \ref{deliverables} Scope of Work for a detailed list of what is required.
\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
\hspace{5mm}Not applicable. The application is not intended for University of Maryland students. The application shall incorporate functions of the UMD Google Calendar Schedule Importer to McMaster University using Mosaic and similar platforms. 
\subsection{Risks}
\hspace{5mm}
Mosaic's schedule layout may change in the future. Hence, the application must be updated to account for the changes as the application will become non-functional.

\subsection{Costs}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finanical:\\
\\
Not Applicable. The application shall be free and open for all McMaster University students. 
		
\item Time:
\begin{itemize}
\item 12 lab sessions x 2 hours each = 24 mandatory hours spent in lab.
\item 9 In-person meetings x 1 hours each = 9 hours.
\item These figures are approximations, real times may vary:
\begin{itemize}
\item 10 hours of online meetings
\item 15 hours for development
\item 5 hours for testing
\item 25 hours for documentation
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Total estimated hours needed: 88 hours.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\hspace{5mm}
No user training will be required. The software shall be straightforward and intuitive to use. User prompts will guide users when necessary. A user guide (documentation) will list the features of the program and reiterate instructions. 
\subsection{Waiting Room}
\hspace{5mm}
Integration with facebook events, Mac Rec Schedule, and custom personal events. 

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
\hspace{5mm}
The original source code uses Google's API.  There's an API Client Library for the Python programming language. It is important that the final implementation of the application is an executable. This conversion must be taken into consideration to make installation easy for the end-user.
